# Giub fork of Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

This repo has some other advantages:

- vscode-prettier pre configured `.vscode/settings.json`
- sass glob importer (from every .scss you can import <folder_name>/\*)
